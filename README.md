This is the readme file for Milestone 1 of the Plant v Zombies programming project, completed by David Falardeau 
and Murdock Walsh. Along with this file includes a files that contain the final draft UML diagrams for this 
first milestone and the Eclipse project containing all the coding for this first milestone, which includes some of 
the documentation deliverable elements(explanation of design choices and user controls), complete with all proper 
commenting for ease of understanding. The coding up to now implements a nearly functional text based version of
Plants v Zombies. The code is currently comprised of three classes, with two packages set aside for the next
milestone. The bulk of the code is contained within the PnZModel class, which instiates the other two classes,
Plant and Zombie, within to execute the game. current known issues include Zombie objects not stopping to attack 
Plant objects in the game, and currently there's no user input implemented. Along with the correction of these
minor issues, the future roadmap for the project will involve the addition of a GUI, followed by the complete 
implementation, then the addition of Save/Load feature and a Level Builder mechanic.
